# Spectral filtering
## Using python to solve for the following:

Given an audio file (test.wav) which is noisy, you need to filter it in the following ways 
1.	Time domain (moving averaging filter)
2.	Frequency domain filtering
3.	Perform spectral subtraction.
(HINT: To load the .wav file in python, use scipy.io.wavfile.read(‘Location of file’))
